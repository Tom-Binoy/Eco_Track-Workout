>Real world:
1. Hey Eco, I was lazy today. I went but stood around for some time, 15min ig. But then I did some curls 20kg dumbell, 2x10 i think. Then did some 50kg squats, but feel like form slipping away in the last two reps. Then went home. I also feel tired.
2. I need motivation bro!! I want to do it, but homeworkouts are always hard. Yk. But I still did those pushups and some squats. Tried sloppy situps too. Might need to rethink our strategy?
3. Eco guess what? I did the same as last time. Surprissingly the exact same.
4. I totally forgot the figures for yesterdays gym. But I did the bench, and the squat meachine.
5. Can you tell me what to do? I'm stuck
